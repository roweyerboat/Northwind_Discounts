# Northwind Sales

## Introduction

This project is looking at the Northwind company's data and utilizing hypothesis tests to give the company some recommendations.  The Northwind database is a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company.

## Questions that I investigated

* Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order?  If so, at what level of discount?
* Do discounts have a statistically significant impact on the revenue produced for a given order?  If so, what level(s) of discount increase revenue?
* Do different regions generate more revenue?  Are discounts a factor of that?
* Do different offices generate more revenue for the company?


## Files included in the Repo
* Jupyter Notebook
* Presentation with recommendations for Northwind
* The original database in sqlite format
